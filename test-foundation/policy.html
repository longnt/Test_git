            <p>This “Privacy Policy” discloses the privacy practices for MySexulator.com. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this web site. It will notify you of the following:</p>
<p>1. What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.</p>
<p>2. What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</p>
<p>3. The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</p>
<p>4. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</strong></p>
<p>A special note about children: This website is not directed to children under the age of 18 and MySexulator.com does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 on this website and all persons registering represent that they are over the age of 18 in order to establish an account. We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Categories of Personal Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>The information collected by MySexulator.com falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to and users of the website and (2) tracking information recorded as visitors and users navigate through the website. Some of this information is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person.</p>
<p>To make use of some features on our website visitors and users need to register and provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may ask, for example, for your name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, and, if you wish to automate payments, financial account information. We consider the personally identifiable information contained in our business records to be confidential.</p>
<p>We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to fulfill an order. However, we do reserve the right to use your information anonymously that is pooled into statistical areas for dissemination and use by the site, or to sell, share or disseminate statistical information to third parties. {For example, the data we collect from our male members may show that males age 25-30 on average have more sex on Friday mornings than males age 40-45}. In all such instances, your data will be part of a statistical pool of data that can be accessed by you or other members so that you can compare your own individual trends with other members, or third parties in different categories.</p>
<p>Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Your Access to and Control Over Information</strong></p>
<p>You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address on our website:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;See what data we have about you, if any.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Change/correct any data we have about you.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Have us delete any data we have about you.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Express any concern you have about our use of your data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>All information gathered on our website is stored within a database accessible only to Mysexulator.com and its specifically authorized contractors and vendors. However, as effective as any security measure implemented by MySexulator.com may be, no security system is impenetrable. We take reasonable precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. However, no amount of data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from our Site, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information. You should always evaluate what type of information you disclose. If you do not want us to know any particular information about you, do not include it in anything that you submit or post to this website or send to us in an e-mail.</p>
<p>Whenever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in the most secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.</p>
<p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in the most secure environment.</p>
<p>Public Access: If you disclose personal information in any discussion forums or other public areas on our Site, that information can be read, collected or used by others to send you unsolicited messages or for other purposes. Our policy does not apply to such information. If you do not want your comments to be viewed by third parties, do not make any such submissions. Also, using our site on a public computer puts you at risk that we cannot anticipate or protect against and therefore, accessing our site from public computers should be done with caution.</p>
<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>
<p>In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give certain information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest. At your option, you may also provide demographic information (such as gender or age) about yourself, but it is not required.</p>
<p><strong>Subscriptions</strong></p>
<p>We request information from you on our join now form. To purchase a subscription from us, you must provide contact information (such as name and email address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your subscription. If we have trouble processing your request, we’ll use this information to contact you.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>We use “cookies” on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor’s hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.</p>
<p><strong>Other Websites</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to link to other websites. To make our website more valuable to our visitors and members, we may offer some features in conjunction with other providers. Our website may also include links to other websites whose privacy policies and practices we do not control, and whose privacy and practices may vary differently from our privacy and practices. You should always check the privacy policies of the websites you access. Once you leave our website by linking to another one (you can tell where you are by checking the address-known as a URL-in the location bar of your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the website you are visiting. If you cannot find the privacy policy of any of these websites via a link from the site’s homepage, you should contact the website directly for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting the revised Privacy Policy in the “Privacy Policy” section of our Site. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to review our Site and the Privacy Policy periodically to learn of any modifications. Your continued use of our Site after the posting of the revised Privacy Policy shall constitute your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Information</strong></p>
<p>You may review and change personally identifiable information that you provide to us through this website by returning to the pages where you entered it, and reviewing or changing the information directly. You may also request changes to some information, such as billing and account information if you are a MySexulator.com customer, by e-mailing us at the link below.</p>
<p><strong>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email at</strong>: info@mysexulator.com</p>
